## Branded Raspberry Pi Case Lid

This lid (IoT-Watchdog_Voroni-Deckel.stl, white and 
Iot-Watchdog_Schriftzug.stl, blue) is intended to be mated with [Carter Multz](https://www.prusaprinters.org/social/6839-carter-multz/prints)' base cases with hexagonal holes, which are used for the IoT-Watchdog case.

How to mate this lid with Carter's case can be read in a (german) [blog post](https://www.netidee.at/iot-watchdog/gehaeuse-fuer-iot-watchdog).
